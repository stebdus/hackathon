# hackathon - St. PÃ¶lten


# Your challenge
1. Turn a Raspberry PI into a camera
2. Create a web service, that takes a photo, puts it in a S3 object storage and saves metadata in Elasticsearch
3. Create a containerised web app, that shows available cameras and can call your web service

Software in this repo includes two services:

* **camera-webservice**: Web service that exposes a RESTful API to use a local webcam to take a photo, upload it to an S3 target, and posts metadata to ElasticSearch.  The service is written in Python and configured using a json formatted conf file. This service can be deployed on a raspberry pi or your laptop.

* **webapp**: Web app that queries ElasticSearch for available cameras and existing photos and displays them. Also allows taking new photos by calling the RESTful API of the camera-webservice.  This app is written in Ruby and includes a Dockerfile for containerized use.

## Getting help
* Google and YouTube are your best friends. If you have a question, are getting an error message, or need to learn something, then google first
* If you then get stuck, ask your teammates
* If you are still stuck, ask Stefan for help

## Hacking steps

As with any tech challenge proceed in steps and verify all is well (including your knowledge) before continuing. 

### Setup your infrastructure

1. Build your Raspberry Pi and access it via SSH.  What linux does it run?  Is your internet access working?  Use `curl` to read `http://www.google.com`
1. Setup your S3 bucket on the StorageGrid Webscale system (see credentials on whiteboard):
 * Install a S3 browser tool like "*S3 browser*" for Windows or "*CyberDuck*" for Mac 
 * Create a bucket for your Pi using the credentials supplied; pick a bucket name that is unique for your team
 * Use your S3 client to put stuff in the bucket and get it out
 * Try to access the stuff in the bucket from your web browser.  What URL would you use?  Do you get access denied?  Then set the [bucket_policy.json](bucket_policy.json) to allow anonymous `read` and `list` anonymous access to objects and try again.
 * Note: CyberDuck won't allow you to set Bucket Policies, so you will have to do this another way. Ask Stefan if you can't google it :-) (Hint: s3cmd or aws cli)

### Setup the camera-webservice on the Raspberry Pi
